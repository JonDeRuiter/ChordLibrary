I've created this library to handle the basic functions of finding the names of chords. I hope to use it as a base for a couple other projects and possibly extend it.

To add this to another project, open that project in MVS, right click on the project in solution explorer and add it as a resource.

Exposed methods:
	InsertChord
	FindChord
	GetAllChords -- intended for diagnostics of chord data
